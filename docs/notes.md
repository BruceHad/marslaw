### Structure

Using Bootstrap so have a copy of the bootstrap source. Keeping that in a separate folder and importing the files that I need.

So the basic folder structure looks a bit like this:

	public
		css
		font
		js
		index.html
	src
		bootstrap

src/bootstrap contains the bootstrap .less files.

In the css folder I have a main.less file
